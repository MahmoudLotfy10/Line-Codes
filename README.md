# Line Codes      
## The Details of implementation 
The project entails the implementation of various line coding techniques         
including Unipolar Signaling, Polar Non-Return to Zero, and Return to Zero,        
for the transmission of binary data through simulated waveforms.
In this project is wanted to generate an ensemble comprising 500 waveforms,each consisting of 100 bits, using the specified line codes.        
They are then required to analyze and compute several essential parameters for the generated waveforms, such as the statistical mean, the stationarity of the random process, the ensemble autocorrelation function, the time mean, the autocorrelation function for one waveform, the ergodicity of the random process, and the bandwidth of the transmitted signal.
